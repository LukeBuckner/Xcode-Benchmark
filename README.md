# Xcode-Benchmark
A simple Xcode benchmark test written in Swift that tests a Mac's computational power, returning the time to complete each task once the benchmark has completed. 
This benchmark test was created using the latest public build of Xcode at the time (Version 15.1). 
The test was built and tested on Apple Silicon machines - an M1 base model Mac mini and a higher spec M2 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. 
Average completion time on M2 Pro was around 21 seconds.
